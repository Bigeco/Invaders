Team Introduction
we are "bokhakhatjo" with developing Item system.

Team Requirements
Item System.

Detailed Requirements
We will make it so that enemies drop items when killed. These items include debuff items and buff items. Buff items consist of explosives, a three-round burst gun, and a fire rate increase. Debuff items include stat reductions (attack speed, movement speed), stun, weapon deletion, and reverse movement direction.
